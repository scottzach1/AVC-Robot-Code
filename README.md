WEEK 1:

Started building the robot 
- the base and supporting structure of the robot 
- attached the motors and wheels

WEEK 2:

- attached the PCB and camera onto the front of the robot 
- made structure for the IR sensors to attach to 
- finished main build/structure of the robot 

WEEK 3:

- attached IR sensors on both sides of the robot but not on the front 
- began coding for different functions and parts of the robot program
    - connecting to the server for the gate opener 
    - line tracker 
    - writing core code of the robot - can go up till quadrant B, but can't detect and follow the line properly 
    
WEEK 4:

Monday 21st May
- completing core code for robot
 - extending and improving code 
    - having problems with our code, robot keeps moving around in circles when code is executed and run - FIXED
    - also found a problem that the right motor of the robot was turning the wheel backwards (left motor was going in the           right direction) - FIXED 
    - settling with the DELL slider instead of the marble roller as not necessary and the DELL slider works perfectly fine
    
Tuesday 22nd May 
- robot can successfully navigate its way through quadrant a and b - up till quadrant c
- removing the DELL slider and replacing it with the marble roller as the DELL slider was not as smooth on the practice course   boards, it would stick to the board.
- started on code for quadrant c - detecting lines to turn sharp corners
